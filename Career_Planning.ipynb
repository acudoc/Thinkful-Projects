DuckDuckgo, I like thier message \"the search engine that does not track you\" it seems like it would be nice to work with people who promote that message. US soccer, I have always loved soccer (played and coached) and then need all the help they can get right now. Amazon, because I would learn alot and it would be nice to a cheap prime membership. Mayo Clinic, they are the best healthcare system with alot of research opportunities."

    "1) My ideal job would be working on a team where I could specialize in python and deep learning to solve complex problems on large data sets. Within, that context I would enjoy being at a company who use health and ecomnic data to make predictive models to solve an organizations problems. Through prior experience I see how many decisions are based on some combination of money and/or heatlh. I would think there would several different companies that would possible take this approach to help achieve thier business model goals.\n",

I would like to utilize my research skills, knowledge of health, and ability to find answers in big data set to answer an organizations questions. Many companies look specifically to answers questions uses the same data with newer tools, I would like to use data from multiple categories to create solutions older models would never consider.\n",
